    "body": "Shiva, one of the principal deities in Hinduism, is revered as the Supreme Being within Shaivism, a major tradition within Hinduism. Known as the `Destroyer`` within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity that includes Brahma and Vishnu, Shiva's role is to destroy the universe in order to recreate it, symbolizing the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. He is often depicted with a third eye, symbolizing wisdom and insight, and adorned with serpents, symbolizing his mastery over the primal forces of nature. Shiva is also known as the patron god of yoga, meditation, and arts, and is often depicted in deep meditation or performing the Tandava, a vigorous dance that is the source of the cycle of creation, preservation, and dissolution.",

    "body": "Rudraksha, meaning `Tears of Rudra`` (Shiva), are seeds from the Elaeocarpus ganitrus tree, considered sacred in Hinduism for their spiritual and healing properties. These beads are traditionally used as prayer beads, particularly in the worship of Shiva, and are believed to provide protection, bring peace, and enhance spiritual growth. The beads vary in size and the number of facets or `mukhis`` they have, each type possessing different spiritual benefits. Wearing Rudraksha is said to align the chakras, balance energies, and foster a connection with the divine, thus aiding in meditation and spiritual practices.",
